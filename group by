Key Concepts in Grouping and Aggregation
Group By Clause: When you use the GROUP BY clause, you are grouping rows that have the same values in specified columns into aggregated data. 
All columns in the SELECT statement that are not part of an aggregate function must be included in the GROUP BY clause.

Aggregate Functions: Functions like MIN(), MAX(), SUM(), AVG(), and COUNT() perform calculations on a set of values and return a single value. 
These functions can be used in conjunction with GROUP BY to provide aggregated results.


Do's:
Correct Use of GROUP BY with Aggregates:

sql
Copy code
SELECT
    product_id,
    MIN(year) AS first_year
FROM
    Sales
GROUP BY
    product_id;

Explanation: Here, we are grouping by product_id and using the aggregate function MIN(year) to get the first year each product was sold. This is correct because product_id is in the GROUP BY clause and year is used within the aggregate function MIN().
Including Multiple Aggregated Columns:

sql
Copy code
SELECT
    product_id,
    MIN(year) AS first_year,
    MAX(price) AS max_price
FROM
    Sales
GROUP BY
    product_id;
Explanation: This query correctly groups by product_id and includes two aggregate functions: MIN(year) and MAX(price). Both year and price are used in aggregate functions, so this is correct.
Don'ts:
Selecting Non-Aggregated Columns Not in GROUP BY:

sql
Copy code
SELECT
    product_id,
    MIN(year) AS first_year,
    price
FROM
    Sales
GROUP BY
    product_id;
Issue: price is neither part of an aggregate function nor included in the GROUP BY clause. This is incorrect because SQL does not know which price value to select for each product_id.
Incorrect Grouping Leading to Ambiguities:

sql
Copy code
SELECT
    product_id,
    year,
    COUNT(*)
FROM
    Sales
GROUP BY
    product_id;
Issue: year is selected but not aggregated or included in the GROUP BY clause. This creates ambiguity because there can be multiple year values for each product_id.

difference between group by and partition by:

The PARTITION BY clause and the GROUP BY clause are both used to divide data into groups, but they serve different purposes and are used in different contexts. Here's a detailed explanation of the differences between them, along with examples.

GROUP BY
The GROUP BY clause is used to aggregate data across multiple rows. It groups rows that have the same values in specified columns into summary rows, such as calculating sums or averages.

Key Points:
Used in conjunction with aggregate functions (e.g., SUM(), COUNT(), AVG(), MIN(), MAX()).
Each group returns a single row in the result set.
All columns in the SELECT statement that are not part of an aggregate function must be included in the GROUP BY clause.
Example:
Let's say we have a Sales table with the following data:

product_id	year	quantity	price
100	2008	10	5000
100	2009	12	5000
200	2011	15	9000
We want to get the total quantity sold for each product:

sql
Copy code
SELECT
    product_id,
    SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity
FROM
    Sales
GROUP BY
    product_id;
Result:
product_id	total_quantity
100	22
200	15
